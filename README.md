## Creating the project

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>

#### Create a Django Project:

Create a new Django project with the command django-admin startproject CrudDjango. This will generate a basic directory and file structure for your project.

```
django-admin startproject CrudDjango
```

#### Create a Module:

A Django app is a self-contained module within a Django project that is designed to perform a specific function. Each app can handle a different aspect of the web application, such as user authentication, blog posts, or a shopping cart. Apps in Django are reusable and can be included in multiple projects.

Run the command python manage.py startapp Home to create a new app named "Home". This will generate a directory with the necessary files for the app.


```
python manage.py startapp Home
```
```
python manage.py startapp Material
```

#### Add the App to INSTALLED_APPS:

Open the settings.py file and add 'Home' to the INSTALLED_APPS list. This step is essential for Django to recognize and apply any changes made within the "Home" app.

#### Run the Development Server:

Navigate to the project directory and start the development server with the command python manage.py runserver. This will start a local server, allowing you to view your project in a web browser.

```
python manage.py runserver
```

# Project Documentation

## Create Models

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>

In Django, models are the heart of your web applicationâ€™s data structure. They define the structure of your database, encapsulating essential fields and behaviors of the data you want to store. Each model class typically maps to a single database table, where class attributes represent the columns of the table.

#### Model Material

This Django code defines a model class named Material, which represents a database table where each instance of the class corresponds to a row in that table.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02a6b8e-f828-4cf7-9122-2e544c1b57c2)

#### Forms based Model Material

This Django code defines a form class called MaterialForm, which is a subclass of forms.ModelForm. This form is specifically designed to work with the Material model, allowing users to create or update Material instances through a web form.

In short, it creates a skeleton of how the model form will be represented on the screen if you directly use {{ form.as_p }}

#### Model Order: One to Many

- Change Models.py : Define the Order model, which will have a ForeignKey field for the Material model.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7b52ea-45a0-47b3-bca2-2bdf64a55a52)

- python manage.py makemigrations

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/177553f8-56a3-4c6c-9ba4-7d5ace98b327)

- python manage.py migrate

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2e0a076-10ad-49c6-8860-ba55cee4c070)

- Change Forms.py: If you want to allow creating or editing orders through a form, you need to define a Django form.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7f3c615-0559-463f-816f-723d0536ed2e)

- Change Views.py(Controller): Define the views that will process the HTTP directives and pass the data to the template.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4f5a55f-e335-45f4-a9ef-f15ea01a00c9)

- Change Urls.py: Define the views that will process the HTTP directives and pass the data to the template.

## Migrations

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>

Creating and applying migrations in Django involves two key commands:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e07c7c27-3cee-40ca-98b1-6f77feac8df2)


#### makemigrations: 

```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

This command generates migration files based on the changes you've made to your models. Migrations are a way to record changes to your database schema, such as creating tables, adding fields, or modifying existing ones. Running makemigrations tells Django to look at your models and create the necessary migration scripts to reflect any changes.

#### migrate:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

This command applies the migration files to your database, executing the necessary SQL commands to update your database schema. Running migrate ensures that your database is synchronized with the current state of your models, applying all pending migrations in the correct order.

## Template Inheritance

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>


#### Config Templates

Make sure the configuration for the template directories is correct. Typically there should be something like this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e50186d4-95a3-48e4-9277-0dc0b414964f)

#### Layout (Master Page):

Create a base template file: Typically, this file is called base.html and is located in your application's templates folder or project's templates directory.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83b535ee-baa6-4396-9232-88093580df1d)

###### Base.html

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13e08718-7b78-4711-a006-49cc80f0ec1b)


#### Rendering Content

Create other templates that extend the base template: In each of your individual templates, you use the {% extends %} tag to inherit the base.html structure and define the specific content with the {% block %} tag

## Controller

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>

In django controllers are called views, responsible for processing HTTP requests, interacting with the model and rendering responses, usually in the form of HTML templates

#### Creating a Controller:

To create a controller, create a file called views.py inside the app

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60cbee00-ba90-4c22-8d98-8bf1ea17f9c5)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1673cecd-28b4-4bff-9e6c-729c127698fc)


### Actions

#### material_list(request):

This function handles requests to display a list of all Material objects. It retrieves all Material instances from the database using Material.objects.all(). The retrieved data is then passed to the template 'material/material_list.html' through the context dictionary, where it is available under the key 'materiais'.


#### material_detail(request, pk):

This function displays the details of a single Material object identified by its primary key (pk). It fetches a specific Material object from the database using get_object_or_404, which raises a 404 error if the object is not found. The object is then passed to the template 'material/material_detail.html' with the key 'material'.

#### material_create(request):

This function handles the creation of a new Material object.

- If the request method is POST, it means the form has been submitted. The form is populated with POST data, and if the form is valid, it saves the new Material object and redirects to its detail page.
- If the request method is GET (or any method other than POST), it creates an empty form. The form is then rendered using the template 'material/material_form.html'.

#### material_update(request, pk):

This function handles updating an existing Material object.


- If the request method is POST, it populates the form with the submitted data and the existing Material instance. If the form is valid, it saves the updated object and redirects to its detail page.
- For any other request method (typically GET), it initializes the form with the existing Material data and renders it using the template 'material/material_form.html'.

#### material_delete(request, pk):

This function handles the deletion of a Material object.

- If the request method is POST, it deletes the Material object from the database and redirects to the material list page.
- For non-POST requests (usually GET), it renders a confirmation page 'material/material_confirm_delete.html', where the user can confirm the deletion.

## Routes

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>

#### Configure the app URLs:

In the urls.py file within the material folder, you define routes specific to that application. This involves importing views and creating URL patterns that map URLs to corresponding view functions or classes. For example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda8dc3d-b56b-488d-b9e5-4f11512a9bf7)


#### Include the app URLs in the main URLs:

After defining the routes in the material app, you need to include these URLs in the main urls.py file of the project. This ensures that Django knows about the app's routes and can route them correctly. You do this by using the include() function to add the app's URLs to the main project URL pattern:

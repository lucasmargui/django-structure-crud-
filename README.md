## Creating the project

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>

#### Create a Django Project:

Create a new Django project with the command django-admin startproject CrudDjango. This will generate a basic directory and file structure for your project.

```
django-admin startproject CrudDjango
```

#### Create a Module:

A Django app is a self-contained module within a Django project that is designed to perform a specific function. Each app can handle a different aspect of the web application, such as user authentication, blog posts, or a shopping cart. Apps in Django are reusable and can be included in multiple projects.

Run the command python manage.py startapp Home to create a new app named "Home". This will generate a directory with the necessary files for the app.


```
python manage.py startapp Home
```
```
python manage.py startapp Material
```

#### Add the App to INSTALLED_APPS:

Open the settings.py file and add 'Home' to the INSTALLED_APPS list. This step is essential for Django to recognize and apply any changes made within the "Home" app.

#### Run the Development Server:

Navigate to the project directory and start the development server with the command python manage.py runserver. This will start a local server, allowing you to view your project in a web browser.

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Create Models

<details>
<summary>Click to show details about </summary>



In Django, models are the heart of your web applicationâ€™s data structure. They define the structure of your database, encapsulating essential fields and behaviors of the data you want to store. Each model class typically maps to a single database table, where class attributes represent the columns of the table.

#### Model Material

This Django code defines a model class named Material, which represents a database table where each instance of the class corresponds to a row in that table.

#### Forms based Model Material

This Django code defines a form class called MaterialForm, which is a subclass of forms.ModelForm. This form is specifically designed to work with the Material model, allowing users to create or update Material instances through a web form.

In short, it creates a skeleton of how the model form will be represented on the screen if you directly use {{ form.as_p }}
